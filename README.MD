# JSON Parse Homework - Tests

For this homework I was required to test a **JSON** file constructed using **Mockaroo**.  The **JSON** was parsed using the **JSON** gem and the tested using the 5 constucted tests to make sure that the datastructure worked correctly.

The tests for this target each layer of the structure.  The structures tested include arrays and hashes.
